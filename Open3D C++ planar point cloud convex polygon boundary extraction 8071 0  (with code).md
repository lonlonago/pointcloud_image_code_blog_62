##  I. Overview of algorithms 

  The convex hull (convex_hull) is a concept of computational graphics. In two-dimensional space, the convex hull can be regarded as the minimum convex polygon of all points in a point set. At present, there are many C++ implemented two-dimensional convex hull codes on the Internet, but they have not been specifically applied to the extraction of convex polygon boundaries from plane point clouds. Therefore, combined with the existing reference materials and codes on the Internet, I make appropriate modifications to make the two-dimensional convex hull algorithm can be applied to the extraction of convex polygons from plane point clouds.
